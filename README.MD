# ShapEx Nutritional Counseling

## Knowing your nutritional requirements was never this easy!

The following topics were approached during development:

* Initial setup using Spring Boot Initializer.
* Database creation and entity mapping at a SQL Mysql database using ORM (Spring data JPA).
* REST architecture commands were implemented for user interaction with database.
* Api documentation using OpenApi specification for better understanding of what the api does.

After running the project, use the following link to visualize the api in action: 

```
http://localhost:8080/openapi
```

The following tools were used during the project development:

* Java 11 or later versions.
* SpringBot 2.7.1
* Maven 3.8.6 or later versions
* MySql and Mysql Workbench as a GUI.
* OpenAPI 3.0 specification was used to document the Api endpoints.
